                          <p>{% trans %}Radar images can be obtained regardless of cloud conditions and rain, which facilitates the building up of mosaic images with several scenes. In the case of French Guiana, the 18 scenes needed to cover the entire territory were collected in a few months time frame. It is obvious, though, that displaying simultaneously all 18 images in a unique image results in a diminished resolution. Several fields of application are presented in order to appreciate the interest of ERS images and to understand to what extent they have translated certain properties of the landscapes (successively: Relief, vegetation zones, the coast, the town of Kourou, the Saut Maripa). Finally, you will access an animation summarizing the main properties of the images.{% endtrans %}</p>

The image is in fact a top vegetation image, because ERS radar waves barely penetrate the forest cover (ERS wave length is 6 cm). The impression on the relief is strong. The Geometric and radiometric distortions lead to the presence of relief due to the existence of a bright area, narrower than in reality with slopes facing the radar, and a darker area with slopes facing away: the contrast is naturally perceived by the human eye as a relief area.{% endtrans %}</p>

It consists of two spacecraft, ERS-1 and ERS•2. launched in 1991 and 1995, respectively. both equipped with a SAR Synthetic Aperture Radar instrurnent with a high spatial resolution of about 25 m. The radar captures detailed views of the Earth surface. The observation system is based on an active receptor that illuminates the Earth surface and measures the reflected signal. Data are available at day and nighttime. independently from solar illumination. Moreover, as the radar signal penetrates clouds without weakening. images can be obtained regardless of climatic conditions.{% endtrans %}</p>

                          <p>{% trans %}Let us quickly summarize how the radar response evolved with the properties of the surface according to the different media encountered On the surface of the water: waves do not penetrate. If the surface is smooth, the re-flection is specular, there is no return to the antenna, and the image is dark. If the sur-face is rough the response increases and the image becomes brighter. Note that the roughness of the surface is evaluated relative to the wavelength, with a threshold separating smooth and rough media on the order of a quarter of the wavelength. (see the example on this page 'the maripa jump') On built-up areas: walls and various structures generally lead to a strong response and these areas often appear as light or even white spots on the images. (see on this page the application 'the city of Kourou') On vegetation and other natural environments:: In the case of natural landscapes, the surface conditions are very diverse and they generally lead to responses which allow them to be differentiated. The response of the vegetation depends on a large number of parameters related to the biomass and the structure of the plants. When the forest cover is dense and homogeneous, the energy response of the canopy is uniform but, for geometric reasons, the radar image then essentially reflects the forms of the relief (.

                          <p>{% trans %}Towns  imaged by radar as very rough surfaces, appear generally as bright spots. Buildings appear as bright dots (strong reflection) if the density of constructions is low. Examples include: 'The town of Kourou' (in this section), and  'The Cayenne and Kourou example'.{% endtrans %}</p>

                          <p>{% trans %}Types of vegetation cover found in natural landscapes are quite various. They can generally be discriminated due to their own back-scattering coefficient. Forested areas are characterised by intermediate back-scattering coefficients, the values of which depend on a great number of parameters: main shapes of trunks and branches, density and electrical properties of foliage, etc.. A dense and homogeneous forest ewer shows up in the image as uniform: the radar basics Ily'translates' the relief shapes.
